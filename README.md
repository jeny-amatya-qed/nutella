##Configurations##
# Configuration
Nutella doesn't demand much — it’s a simple treat. However, if you want to customize your experience:
1. Create a .nutellarc file in the root directory:
 ```json
   {
    "sweetnessLevel": "extra",
    "enableMemes": true,
    "theme": "chocolate"
  }
```
2. Adjust the settings to match your taste buds. Here's a breakdown of the options:
- `sweetnessLevel`: Choose from `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"extra"`.
- `enableMemes`: true to keep the laughs coming, false if you're all business.
- `theme`: Pick your favorite flavor — `"chocolate"`, `"vanilla"`, or `"strawberry"`.
